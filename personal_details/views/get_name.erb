Hello my name is Loretta
This is fun.  
Jesus is my best friend.
Life can be easy or hard.  We chose each day to be good or bad.  It is our reaction to valleys that make us WANT to climb to the 
top of the mountain, there is where we can only be stronger.  Our strength is inward, we learn to lean on God for strength, for we cannot go it alone.  We can only find strength in hardships for our inward being kicks in and is reborn again.
